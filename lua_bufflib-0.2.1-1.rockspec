A library for string buffers in Lua.

The buffer code in this library is largely adapted from Lua 5.2's luaL\_Buffer code.
The main difference is that Buffers store their contents in the registry instead of the stack when their length exceeds LUAL\_BUFFERSIZE.
This prevents the C char array holding the current contents from being garbage collected until a larger array is required or the Buffer is reset or garbage collected.
You don't need to know any of this to use the library, it's just extra information for people curious about the implementation.

Just like regular strings in Lua, string buffers can contain embedded nulls (\0).

Similar to Lua's string library, most Buffer methods can be called as `buff:method(...)` or `bufflib.method(buff, ...)` (where `buff` is a Buffer).
Note that not all methods use the same name in the Buffer metatable and the `bufflib` table.
The primary examples of this are the metamethods, which use the required metamethod names in the metatable and more descriptive names in the `bufflib` table (e.g. the `__len` metamethod is the same as `bufflib.length`).

In addition to the functions shown here, you can call any method from the global `string` table (not just functions from the string library) on a Buffer (either as a method or a function from the `bufflib` table) by prefixing the name with `s_`.
When you call a Buffer method with the `s_` prefix, it calls the equivalent `string` function with the Buffer's contents as the first argument followed by any other arguments supplied to the method. None of these methods modify the original Buffer.

For example, `bufflib.s_gsub(buff, ...)` and `buff:s_gsub(...)` are both equivalent to `str:gsub(...)` (where `buff` is a Buffer and `str` is the Buffer's contents as a string).

Buffers define metamethods for equality (==), length (#), concatenation (..) and tostring(). See the documentation of each metamethod for details.
